# Overview

This project serves as a guide for people who want to try their hand at making a pull request on GitHub.

In conjuction with Hacktoberfest 2020 organised by Digital Ocean.

# What is Git and GitHub?

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a version control system for tracking and manage changes in your files.

[GitHub](https://github.com) is an online hosting service for Git, where you can keep your files online, collaborate with others, manage issues and many more. It's also where a lot of open source projects are hosted!

GitHub is not the only online service out there - there are others like [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).

For Hacktoberfest, your contributions will be tracked on GitHub only.

## Explore on GitHub

The Explore tab is where you can find all the happening stuff - you can check out trending repositories and scroll through various topics.

Some repositories are tagged with **topics** to attract first-time contributors and seasoned gurus alike.

Some popular topics are [`hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest), [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue), [`contributions-welcome`](https://github.com/topics/contributions-welcome), [`up-for-grabs`](https://github.com/topics/up-for-grabs), [`first-timers`](https://github.com/topics/first-timers)

On a repository you will see an "Issues" tab, where there are a list of items that people have added which could be a bug to fix, a feature to add, a performance improvement, anything!


![GitHub Issues](img/issues.png)

Some issues are tagged with **labels**, which allow people to see at a glance the nature of the issue. You can click into Labels to see how many are in a given repository (some popular ones to entice contributors are `help wanted` or `good first issue`).
